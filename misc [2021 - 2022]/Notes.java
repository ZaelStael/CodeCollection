// Variables are how we can tell our computers to allocate space to a specific
// valaue. These variable each have their own unique address in the computers
// memory. The memory taken up by a variiable is directly correlated to the type
// of variable it is. There are many types such as string, int, etc. that each
// have their own parameters for the types of data that can go into them.
// Placing/storing values inside of variable is often known as assignment,
// usually using the assignment operator "=". But note, assigning values to
// variables are a 1 and done type deal. What I mean by this is that a variable
// can have no more than one value, not that you can't redefine it purposefully
// later. Be careful with your names. Meaningful even.
// String myName = Tyrique; is a variable if I were to use: System.out.println
// (myName);, "Tyrique" would appear on the screen.
// In order to input values into the system you'll need to use a scanner. Using
// a scanner requires you to import java.util as well

// In java there are plenty of shortcuts to help you clean up your writng.
// Literal Strings can be added into a string to substitute for spaces, new
// lines, and more
// \t- Replaces the tab button, \n- Starts a new line as if pressing the enter
// button, \"- Allows you to actually show quotation marks in your output, \\-
// An actual backslash.
// Conversions are typically added to values in oder to change them over from
// their original type to the one indicated by you. Lerts focus on the main
// four.
// %s- converts the value into a string type object/value, %d- Reformats the
// value as a decimal integer, %f- Reformats the value as a decimal number, %n-
// creates a new line after the aforementioned value.

// Selection statements are easier to see with a flow chart. Selection
// Statements include If, If Else, Switch
// and various others that we won't get into right now. Let's focus on If Else
// for now. The program allows you to preform a specific action
// (run a line of code) if certain conditions are met. If they aren't,
// replacement code runs in its place. In regular If statements
// you can only check for specific conditions being true, and command the
// machine to respond accordingly. With If Else however, you have
// the ability to code responses for if the condition is met AND not met in ONE
// code block. Oh and last but not least, Don't forget to keep
// track of brackets. They get really confusing if you let them get messy,
// especially in higher level programs.
